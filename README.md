Explanation of Exercises 
=======
This repo contains the solutions for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Coursera course.
The Machine Learning course teaches the building blocks of machine learning,
and the exercises completed in this repo implement the algorithms / functions
described in the course. This README serves to provide a logical explanation 
for the concepts involved in those exercises.

## Intro to Supervised Learning
Some of the initial exercises focus on solving problems which fall into the
category of **supervised learning**. These sorts of problems all follow this
general model:  
1. Acquire a labeled training set, where some number of features X maps to a 
single result Y. 

## Exercise 1 : Linear Regression
Linear Regression is most commonly applied
